### How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 

Graceful degradation is a way of creating applications so that even if certain features or resources become unavailble due to various issues (hardware limitations, connection issues, etc.) it will still be able to function at a certain standard. Service workers are related to graceful degradation as they act as a way to implement this design ideology. Service workers help support web apps to continue running even with slow or no network connection by responding to requests with cached resources. So even if there is weak to no connection, the web app will be able to continue functioning, which supports the idea of graceful degradation. This is how these two things we learned are related.
